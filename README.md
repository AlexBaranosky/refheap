# The Refuse Heap!

This is a little Clojure pastebin project that shells out to pygmentize for syntax highlighting. As such, it supports generally whatever Pygments supports.

## Usage

```bash
lein deps
./fetch-pyg.sh
lein run
```

## Who We Are

We are [Anthony Grimes](https://github.com/Raynes) and [Alex McNamara](https://github.com/amcnamara). We like pastebins.

## Kudos

I use a nice little locked padlock icon next to private pastes on user pages when said user is signed in and viewing his own page. This icon is part of the RRZE icon set that is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported, which means that all I have to do is attribute the work to the creators. As such, here is me attributing.
